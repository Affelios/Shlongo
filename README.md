# Shlongo 📦
*A C# automated migration framework for MongoDB.*

---

## 🚀 What Is Shlongo
Shlongo is a lightweight, opinionated framework to help manage **database schema/data migrations** in MongoDB using C#, which helps you version, apply, and rollback changes safely—automating repetitive tasks so your team spends less time worrying about migration chaos.

---

## ✨ Features
- Organised, versioned migrations  
- Automatic discovery & execution of migrations in order  
- Integration-friendly: works inside existing .NET / C# projects

using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CreateUsersCollectionMigration : Migration
{
    public override async Task Up(IMongoDatabase database)
    {
        await database.CreateCollectionAsync("users");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

        builder.Services.AddShlongo(config =>
        {
            config.MongrationAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            config.MongoClientSettings = MongoClientSettings.FromConnectionString(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("mongo"));
            config.MongoDatabaseName = "mongodb";
        });
    }
}
```
